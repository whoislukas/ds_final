Hey! 👋

It’s Christine Ellis, Head Nutritionist at ColonBroom.

If this is your first time using a fiber supp, you definitely have some questions – as you should! Let’s cover everything you need to know ASAP! ⬇️

#1 How should I use ColonBroom?

Mix 1 scoop of ColonBroom powder with a 360–420ml glass of water. During the first week, drink it 1 time a day, 30–60 minutes before a meal. After one week, increase your intake up to 2 times per day (morning and evening), 30–60 minutes before a meal. Follow up with an extra glass of water (360–420ml).

#2 Can ColonBroom cause bloating? 

The dietary fiber in ColonBroom is generally safe. If you’re new, you might feel a little bloated for the first few days. But don’t worry, your body simply needs to adjust to the increased fiber intake.

#3 When will I feel the effects of ColonBroom?

It depends on your individual metabolic response. You should start feeling the changes in your bowel movement within 12–24 hours. More noticeable results can appear after 72 hours.

#4 What is the main ingredient of ColonBroom?

Psyllium husk, a bulk-forming fiber that supports digestive health. It absorbs water and becomes a viscous compound that benefits constipation, diarrhea, blood pressure, and weight loss.

Hi there!

It's Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom…

And I think I can help you go from 195 lb to 130 lb (for good).

I know you’ve been bombarded with sketchy weight loss/detox tea ads that promise to make you look like Jeniffer Aniston… So“pooping” the weight off may sound far-fetched at first. But this isn’t some bullcrap detox tea.

It’s a natural fiber supplement your body NEEDS to function properly. 90% of Americans have a major fiber deficiency, which really messes with weight loss. And we've helped over 100,000 people to achieve their goals by pooping.

Let’s run the numbers real quick:

> 90% of women who used ColonBroom felt lighter after 12 hours.
> 80% recorded long-term weight loss without feeling hunger.
> 95% of women noticed more frequent and regular bowel movements.

One delicious scoop of ColonBroom a day and…

> You’ll flush out pounds of ""stuck poop"" and enjoy smooth, full releases that prevent bloating, including the ones caused by hormones.
> You’ll experience way fewer cravings, gain control over your appetite, and start dropping pounds consistently.
> You’ll keep dropping pounds without changing your diet or having to start a workout.

In 3 months, you won’t believe your eyes. And just when you start doubting yourself and think you'll stop losing weight and regain all of it back... you'll keep doing it until you achieve the dream of 130lb you want.

An evidence-based, lab-tested way to beat hunger pangs

Our nutritionists carefully reviewed the blind spots of appetite suppressants and ensured our new formula addresses them with all-natural, organic, and ecologically sourced ingredients.

The end result is a proprietary glucomannan and cellulose blend that beats cravings in a matter of hours without giving you jitters or anxiety.

Thousands of ColonBroom customers have already used our advanced Appetite Suppressant. They report visible changes in the mirror without restricting their food choices.

They’re simply eating less food each meal without feeling hungry or deprived. Small wonder it's flying off our shelves and has already sold out twice.

Important: The product won’t launch to the public until early 2023. So, if you’d like to have first dibs on our limited, customer-only stock… Don’t snooze this email.

Hi there,
 |

 |


| 
| 
I am very sorry to hear that you have decided to leave us. Ohh these breakup moments… 🥺
 |

 |


| 
| 
I just have one last question. Can you please let us know your subscription cancellation reason? It would help us improve a lot! ❤️
 |

 |


| 
| 
Select the most suitable reason below: 
 |

 |


| 
| 1. It is too expensive |

 |


| 
| 2. I have already reached my goals |

 |


| 
| 3. I have enough ColonBroom from my previous order |

 |


| 
| 4. I don’t like the taste |

 |


| 
| 5. I don’t feel any changes in bloating and/or constipation |

 |


| 
| 6. I don’t feel any changes in weight management |

 |


| 
| 7. Other |

 |


| 
| 
Thank you, and I wish you all the best,
Eve from ColonBroom

I am hoping to be able to cancel this order that I placed last week. I haven’t received an e-mail saying it shipped so I’m hoping it won’t be an issue and I can receive a refund

I recently found out I’m pregnant and my doctor suggested I stop using the product at my last appointment. 

Please let me know,

So today I received my six month supply package and there was only two containers in there. There was a new relabel sign on the box stating it was damaged so I think I’m short four containers. I will post pictures of the box.

Can You Use ColonBroom if You’re on the “X” Diet? 🧐

We get tons of emails every day asking whether ColonBroom is vegan-friendly, safe to use when fasting, on keto, etc.

Let’s put the questions to rest! 👏

Vegetarian/Vegan-Friendly 🌿

Not a single animal was harmed or used while making this happy-pooper-favorite fiber supplement!

Great for Fasting ⏰

ColonBroom won’t break your fast! In fact, it will help it… Psyllium husk powder – the fiber used in ColonBroom – will help you feel full for longer.

Keto’s Best Friend 🥑

Keto is all about fats and protein. That can really clog up your gut! It’s not the most fiber-rich diet. ColonBloom is the perfect addition that will reduce bloating, constipation, and other nasty symptoms that might come with keto.

Pretty Much Works With Everything 🍓

Thanks to its pure, natural, non-GMO formula, ColonBroom works with most diets: Mediterranean, DASH, low-carb, anti-inflammatory, gluten-free, etc.

However, if you have a history of serious bowel blockage or Crohn’s disease, talk to your doctor before taking any fiber supplement!

Fiber supplements can decrease the absorption of certain medications, such as aspirin, carbamazepine, and others. They can also reduce blood sugar levels, which may require an adjustment in your medications or insulin if you have diabetes.

My subscription just recurred, wish I would have at least gotten an email that this was happening again soon as I haven’t even gotten through half of what I was originally sent.

 

But more importantly- I am moving and so I needed warning to update my shipping address.

There is no ETA or any information on the shipping/confirmation even though I was just charged? If I could delay the order it would be best.

Hi there!

It's David, a nutritionist at ColonBroom…

And I think I can help you go from 238 lb to 210 lb (for good).

“Pooping” the weight off may sound far-fetched at first. But this isn’t some bullcrap chemical-filled fat burner shady guys at gyms peddle.

It’s a natural fiber supplement your body NEEDS to function properly. 90% of Americans have a major fiber deficiency, which really messes with weight loss, helps pronounce your beer belly, and retain fat. We've helped over 100,000 people to achieve their goals by pooping.

Let’s run the numbers real quick:

> 90% of men who used ColonBroom felt lighter after 12 hours.
> 80% recorded long-term weight loss without feeling hunger.
> 95% of men noticed more frequent and regular bowel movements.

One delicious scoop of ColonBroom a day and…

> You’ll flush out pounds of ""stuck poop"" and enjoy smooth, full releases that prevent bloating.
> You’ll experience way fewer cravings, gain control over your appetite, and start dropping pounds consistently.
> You’ll keep dropping pounds without changing your diet or having to start a workout.
> You’ll get better results if you do decide to hit the gym and start getting your pump on.

In 3 months, you won’t believe your eyes. And just when you start doubting yourself and think you'll stop losing weight and regain all of it back... you'll keep doing it until you achieve the dream of 210lb you want.

Hey, it’s Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom!

I hope your gut health journey is going great! Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day! Keep going!

Trust me, you’re not in this alone. I’ve been through some nasty gut health issues, as have most ColonBroom users. But a little bit of consistency, small habit changes, and a scoop of ColonBroom can really make a MAJOR difference. 

In fact, I’d like you to meet Sarah. I hope that her story will inspire you to keep going!

""My constipation got pretty bad, I constantly felt tired, had painful bloating, and started gaining weight. A friend who had gone through similar problems before recommended ColonBroom because it worked for her.

It took a few days but my BMs started becoming regular and I didn’t feel nearly as many cravings or hunger. After a week, I felt a lot less bloated and had more energy, and that inspired me to get my yoga mat out of the closet and work out a little. After two weeks, I lost 12 pounds, don’t feel bloated anymore, and found the inspiration to start being more active! Honestly, I didn’t think a fiber supplement could do so much."" 

See? It might take a day, or a week, or even a few but with the right knowledge, you can get some REALLY dramatic results. 

In fact, I’d love to hear about your story, progress, and expectations! I would be incredibly grateful if you hit reply and took a few minutes to share your thoughts and experience. 

There’s the ColonBroom Facebook group, too, where other users share thoughts and help with tips, tricks, and advice. I hope to see you there. :) 

Sending my best!
Christine,

People who've already read it write back to me and tell me it's unlike anything they've ever seen before.

You’ll learn 10 evidence-based mindful eating strategies.

10 new ways to control your appetite.

Implementing just one of them could make a difference.

But if you were to try all 10 of them?

You’ll never go back to being a “regular eater” (aka, an emotional eater). 

Give the book a read and let me know what you think.

> If this is your first time using a fiber supp, you definitely have some questions – as you should! Let’s cover everything you need to know ASAP! ⬇️
> #1 How should I use ColonBroom?
> Mix 1 scoop of ColonBroom powder with a 360–420ml glass of water. During the first week, drink it 1 time a day, 30–60 minutes before a meal. After one week, increase your intake up to 2 times per day (morning and evening), 30–60 minutes before a meal. Follow up with an extra glass of water (360–420ml).
>  
> #2 Can ColonBroom cause bloating? 
> The dietary fiber in ColonBroom is generally safe. If you’re new, you might feel a little bloated for the first few days. But don’t worry, your body simply needs to adjust to the increased fiber intake.
> #3 When will I feel the effects of ColonBroom?
> It depends on your individual metabolic response. You should start feeling the changes in your bowel movement within 12–24 hours. More noticeable results can appear after 72 hours.
> #4 What is the main ingredient of ColonBroom?
> Psyllium husk, a bulk-forming fiber that supports digestive health. It absorbs water and becomes a viscous compound that benefits constipation, diarrhea, blood pressure, and weight loss.

Hey! 👋 

It’s Christine Ellis, Head Nutritionist at ColonBroom.
If this is your first time using a fiber supp, you definitely have some questions – as you should! Let’s cover everything you need to know ASAP! ⬇️
#1 How should I use ColonBroom?
Mix 1 scoop of ColonBroom powder with a 360–420ml glass of water. During the first week, drink it 1 time a day, 30–60 minutes before a meal. After one week, increase your intake up to 2 times per day (morning and evening), 30–60 minutes before a meal. Follow up with an extra glass of water (360–420ml).
 
#2 Can ColonBroom cause bloating? 
The dietary fiber in ColonBroom is generally safe. If you’re new, you might feel a little bloated for the first few days. But don’t worry, your body simply needs to adjust to the increased fiber intake.
#3 When will I feel the effects of ColonBroom?
It depends on your individual metabolic response. You should start feeling the changes in your bowel movement within 12–24 hours. More noticeable results can appear after 72 hours.
#4 What is the main ingredient of ColonBroom?
Psyllium husk, a bulk-forming fiber that supports digestive health. It absorbs water and becomes a viscous compound that benefits constipation, diarrhea, blood pressure, and weight loss.

Hey, it’s Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom!

I hope your gut health journey is going great! Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day! Keep going!

Trust me, you’re not in this alone. I’ve been through some nasty gut health issues, as have most ColonBroom users. But a little bit of consistency, small habit changes, and a scoop of ColonBroom can really make a MAJOR difference. 

In fact, I’d like you to meet Sarah. I hope that her story will inspire you to keep going!

""My constipation got pretty bad, I constantly felt tired, had painful bloating, and started gaining weight. A friend who had gone through similar problems before recommended ColonBroom because it worked for her.

It took a few days but my BMs started becoming regular and I didn’t feel nearly as many cravings or hunger. After a week, I felt a lot less bloated and had more energy, and that inspired me to get my yoga mat out of the closet and work out a little. After two weeks, I lost 12 pounds, don’t feel bloated anymore, and found the inspiration to start being more active! Honestly, I didn’t think a fiber supplement could do so much."" 

See? It might take a day, or a week, or even a few but with the right knowledge, you can get some REALLY dramatic results. 

In fact, I’d love to hear about your story, progress, and expectations! I would be incredibly grateful if you hit reply and took a few minutes to share your thoughts and experience.

There’s the ColonBroom Facebook group (http://trk.colonbroom.com/ls/click?upn=z4MSGTjCvBomUXksLGfA-2FehpOZ64YggyAHoln3IjqjecdZLYDw5trvufYIHqFAmcxuYJKMH804-2F9vfp07cWBEdIC37kjdrl6-2Bo0qT5sRRCnqwj01jbPbTDBkzhxHO7rRVTzcFSMq-2FTE7sVM5MfiJ-2BA8Ygwvd-2Be3Tl5WOlkMXdDCfxEakDI0-2FADPfVCPmUiWHncuI_9D4WaYKX8Hbq8IO5FhOULeSOVEBUflFbz5VXLTDqsH-2BWkxavGk1bAv9x4co92bZt3nH51veXtBd2wgjQjJ40ic5n2p17jcvNjE8oYLbIm72E1XFsa6hnRFBBJWCALV8nWGKGcOhNlv-2FlVCEvRI8R-2BZbOnQ3lIcBLNUBEAjJZv0RDl5gizF7aFVMXYKpc3KKqyxs1IRB7c4sG5at7OLQmVhYrUHGqM0m6U-2FZLVNI3XBXOZJpchk0arghf2-2B6nLOBsMkXc2B9Cq59HIxeHR4jHpm6xOEqjj9ktWVkrgClDfVokPhomSlZ9-2FS8iuq9Y-2FX7YRBDPSgb2GSFQ42HOBtMMsekWa9gr4x2rDfPErW-2F6lkRWS7fcMMVuSYFGoI5q-2FSHgzfVzCG-2Bf8f3njCOtisiIBA-3D-3D) , too, where other users share thoughts and help with tips, tricks, and advice.

I ordered a three month supply of colon broom and am almost done with the first container. Unfortunately, I am not at all satisfied with the product, I has not worked for me as its advertised in the slightest, and I have made sure to take it exactly as directed. I would like to return the two unopened containers I have. I'm very disappointed that colonbroom has not worked for me the way all of your ads and instructions say it would... 
Please let me know how I go about returning the product, with a refund for the two unopened containers.
My Orded ID is: CB-792512
Thanks very much,

I also wanted to let you know that the statement below is offensive and unneccesary to me.It doesn't matter if you are young or old, rich or poor, a queen or the president. Even the Pope needs to take a s**t.

Please confirm that my membership has been cancelled.  I have 2 unopened containers left.  Can I return for a refund please.

I wish I could give you good feedback, but unfortunately I can’t get past consuming the product with its taste/texture and the amount of volume required to put it in. I really wanted this to be a great fit for me, so I am saddened with my findings. Thank you for reaching out.

Our nutritionists carefully reviewed the blind spots of appetite suppressants and ensured our new formula addresses them with all-natural, organic, and ecologically sourced ingredients.

The end result is a proprietary glucomannan and cellulose blend that beats cravings in a matter of hours without giving you jitters or anxiety.

Thousands of ColonBroom customers have already used our advanced Appetite Suppressant. They report visible changes in the mirror without restricting their food choices.

They’re simply eating less food each meal without feeling hungry or deprived. Small wonder it's flying off our shelves and has already sold out twice.

Important: The product won’t launch to the public until early 2023. So, if you’d like to have first dibs on our limited, customer-only stock… Don’t snooze this email.

Tap below to reserve your supply now so you avoid disappointment later.

Hi there!

It's Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom…

And I think I can help you go from 260 lb to 175 lb (for good).

I know you’ve been bombarded with sketchy weight loss/detox tea ads that promise to make you look like Jeniffer Aniston… So“pooping” the weight off may sound far-fetched at first. But this isn’t some bullcrap detox tea.

It’s a natural fiber supplement your body NEEDS to function properly. 90% of Americans have a major fiber deficiency, which really messes with weight loss. And we've helped over 100,000 people to achieve their goals by pooping.

Let’s run the numbers real quick:



> 90% of women who used ColonBroom felt lighter after 12 hours.
> 80% recorded long-term weight loss without feeling hunger.
> 95% of women noticed more frequent and regular bowel movements.



One delicious scoop of ColonBroom a day and…



> You’ll flush out pounds of ""stuck poop"" and enjoy smooth, full releases that prevent bloating, including the ones caused by hormones.
> You’ll experience way fewer cravings, gain control over your appetite, and start dropping pounds consistently.
> You’ll keep dropping pounds without changing your diet or having to start a workout.



In 3 months, you won’t believe your eyes. And just when you start doubting yourself and think you'll stop losing weight and regain all of it back... you'll keep doing it until you achieve the dream of 175lb you want.

Try ColonBroom out and watch what happens.

In 48 hours, you’ll rock a visibly flatter belly with no extra effort at all.

I am in extreme pain and the product turns into gel when mixed into water. Is there anyway to send these back?

3034593,8847364904593,"Hello,
I purchased a 3 pack of Colon Broom and have been using it as directed for over a month. I emailed your help desk after using for a couple of weeks and feeling even more constipated than before. The responses I received were unhelpful, but I continued using it anyway hoping my discomfort was just an adjustment period. It got even worse in this past two weeks to a point that I had to see my doctor. 
Since Colon broom is the only change I have made since my constipation has worsened, she has advised me to stop using it. 
I have two unopened bottles left that I wish to return. Can you please walk me through the process? 
Thank you, 
Holly

 |


| 
| 3. I have enough ColonBroom from my previous order |

 |


| 
| 4. I don’t like the taste |

 |


| 
| 5. I don’t feel any changes in bloating and/or constipation |

 |


|

 |


|

3034867,8764211646737,"Hi
I've only been using Colonbroom for about a week, but almost immediately noticed productive bowel movements and solid waste. I've been diagnosed with Diverticulitis and while I don't feel a lot of symptoms I have been taking fiber and activated charcoal and probiotics to stay ahead of any issues, and Colonbroom was probably the quickest surest difference in my digestion process to date.
I checked on Yuka for the ingredients safety of Colonbroom and it checked out as being safe and effective. My only question is the liquid becomes gelatin like after a bit in my glass, and I need a spoon to basically eat it...Is that standard?
Thanks for checking in,
Ann"

I am writing regarding an order I placed that I would like to return. I ordered a 6 month supply of Colon Broom on 6/13/2022 (confirmation number CB-622164). I have been using the product since then, but it is not working for me and I’m hoping to return it. I see on the website returns are only honored within the first 14 days of purchase, but I also read it is recommended that the product be used for several weeks before returning it. I feel that I have given it a fair chance but I am not satisfied with it. Can you help me with this?

Thank you in advance!

Hi there!

It's David, a nutritionist at ColonBroom…

And I think I can help you go from 290 lb to 200 lb (for good).

“Pooping” the weight off may sound far-fetched at first. But this isn’t some bullcrap chemical-filled fat burner shady guys at gyms peddle.

It’s a natural fiber supplement your body NEEDS to function properly. 90% of Americans have a major fiber deficiency, which really messes with weight loss, helps pronounce your beer belly, and retain fat. We've helped over 100,000 people to achieve their goals by pooping.

Let’s run the numbers real quick:



> 90% of men who used ColonBroom felt lighter after 12 hours.
> 80% recorded long-term weight loss without feeling hunger.
> 95% of men noticed more frequent and regular bowel movements.



One delicious scoop of ColonBroom a day and…



> You’ll flush out pounds of ""stuck poop"" and enjoy smooth, full releases that prevent bloating.
> You’ll experience way fewer cravings, gain control over your appetite, and start dropping pounds consistently.
> You’ll keep dropping pounds without changing your diet or having to start a workout.
> You’ll get better results if you do decide to hit the gym and start getting your pump on.



In 3 months, you won’t believe your eyes. And just when you start doubting yourself and think you'll stop losing weight and regain all of it back... you'll keep doing it until you achieve the dream of 200lb you want.

Try ColonBroom out and watch what happens.

In 48 hours, you’ll rock a visibly flatter belly with no extra effort at all.

It tastes like sweet, fresh strawberries, mixes well with juices, and can even spice up your smoothies. The best part – it’s completely guilt-free. In fact, ColonBroom is good for you. 

✔️ No hard-to-swallow pills or chalky shakes
✔️ Reduces sugar cravings

3030693,9045700773905,"Frankly, I'm very disappointed with how it is going since I started Colon Broom. I purchased Colon Broom strictly for weight loss.  When I entered all of my information into the questionnaire before I ordered the response was that I would lose 50 pounds by October. 
I know that is a very unrealistic expectation, but I was hoping for maybe 20-25 pounds. I have diligently taken CB once each morning for the first week and twice a day in the second week while also intermittently fasting. During the 15 days since I started I have actually GAINED 4 pounds instead of any kind of weight loss. That combined with the stomach aches I'd say I'm extremely upset that I wasted money on 3 months worth of product.

> If this is your first time using a fiber supp, you definitely have some questions – as you should! Let’s cover everything you need to know ASAP! ⬇️
> #1 How should I use ColonBroom?
> Mix 1 scoop of ColonBroom powder with a 360–420ml glass of water. During the first week, drink it 1 time a day, 30–60 minutes before a meal. After one week, increase your intake up to 2 times per day (morning and evening), 30–60 minutes before a meal. Follow up with an extra glass of water (360–420ml).
>  
> #2 Can ColonBroom cause bloating? 
> The dietary fiber in ColonBroom is generally safe. If you’re new, you might feel a little bloated for the first few days. But don’t worry, your body simply needs to adjust to the increased fiber intake.
> #3 When will I feel the effects of ColonBroom?
> It depends on your individual metabolic response. You should start feeling the changes in your bowel movement within 12–24 hours. More noticeable results can appear after 72 hours.
> #4 What is the main ingredient of ColonBroom?
> Psyllium husk, a bulk-forming fiber that supports digestive health. It absorbs water and becomes a viscous compound that benefits constipation, diarrhea, blood pressure, and weight loss.

3033725,9069316599953,Hi I need someone to call me asap please. I only order one bottle and now y’all keep sending bottles and charging me. I want this canceled. 
3030330,9044670319377,Hi I ordered my supplement a couple weeks ago and I’m still waiting on it!! Wondering if there’s any update with shipping?
3030407,9044810264337,How does your guarantee work?  If I subscribe and it’s not for me what is the policy. Also what else is in this product?
3031630,9059294905361,"Good morning-
I ordered colonbroom in August after watching many ads and reading many reviews.

I have been drinking it daily for about a week and a half- 2 weeks.

I am sorry to say that I find the flavor repulsive, it is making me ill and it is to the point that I cannot even swallow it without a gag reflex.  I really tried. I tried mixing it with different things- but it just is not working for me.

I would like to request a refund.  I paid $63.99 and I assume your money back guarantee will cover this request.

Please contact me and let me know.
Here is my contact information- Heather Pennington- 716-903-2609

Thank you.

Subject: How’s your journey going?


Hey, it’s Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom!

I hope your gut health journey is going great! Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day! Keep going!

Trust me, you’re not in this alone. I’ve been through some nasty gut health issues, as have most ColonBroom users. But a little bit of consistency, small habit changes, and a scoop of ColonBroom can really make a MAJOR difference.

In fact, I’d like you to meet Sarah. I hope that her story will inspire you to keep going!

""My constipation got pretty bad, I constantly felt tired, had painful bloating, and started gaining weight. A friend who had gone through similar problems before recommended ColonBroom because it worked for her.

It took a few days but my BMs started becoming regular and I didn’t feel nearly as many cravings or hunger. After a week, I felt a lot less bloated and had more energy, and that inspired me to get my yoga mat out of the closet and work out a little. After two weeks, I lost 12 pounds, don’t feel bloated anymore, and found the inspiration to start being more active! Honestly, I didn’t think a fiber supplement could do so much.""

See? It might take a day, or a week, or even a few but with the right knowledge, you can get some REALLY dramatic results.

In fact, I’d love to hear about your story, progress, and expectations! I would be incredibly grateful if you hit reply<mailto:hello@colonbroom.com> and took a few minutes to share your thoughts and experience.

There’s the ColonBroom Facebook group<https://nam12.safelinks.protection.outlook.com/?url=http%3A%2F%2Ftrk.colonbroom.com%2Fls%2Fclick%3Fupn%3Dz4MSGTjCvBomUXksLGfA-2FehpOZ64YggyAHoln3IjqjecdZLYDw5trvufYIHqFAmcP8CHltx401W0-2FQXqTMik3P3JyFG-2B-2Bj2G9gThEyYYOfqRdFsKxETsQ351TvTkF1WldYqhy-2BylHSJjsmspAs8VO1tO34BdlRGfYmQHZcAh0oI-3Dniw6_blChh-2FwfRFEw8cYqXwgY5nktlxTn-2FyVxHNJPJcMZuRpFe2KXKCX-2Fv87slIfe3WCCYulf0MQRizov-2BcwUWDmOdkHHBEhDsKCdL47JHGkgwT-2Fb3Aiy9HAceRLyfeoTNmM5-2FHSOUwmvY9CwLf-2BIjtP8lo0d1KhhQedmjFZyeENWx3TW-2FcwuPW1Wvn02zjlmE9h4ve7pBKZSyL50RfByLRpH-2FUHLf0yyXPQuvSbQha7yAPWXZyi5jG7GoH8YeHo4fMGqN9qLO-2BXohR4z0C-2BQoKClgX4zCUA-2Fwnnh4pfyq39hgdAHQCGodcdDPmn55DddQu93nqsBjbSYj48uivmZK1vQqzxXvxKIz3HtPs-2FWU5YRMpxcsBPrPGTcQ5irA-2FHFOnnL&data=05%7C01%7C%7Ccac80921259641b6078508da94f510ca%7C84df9e7fe9f640afb435aaaaaaaaaaaa%7C1%7C0%7C637986077522745390%7CUnknown%7CTWFpbGZsb3d8eyJWIjoiMC4wLjAwMDAiLCJQIjoiV2luMzIiLCJBTiI6Ik1haWwiLCJXVCI6Mn0%3D%7C3000%7C%7C%7C&sdata=rAx4zuJKTJlE6%2B2naDCoyly6RGmbjqqdHqlp4lzPCDw%3D&reserved=0>, too, where other users share thoughts and help with tips, tricks, and advice.

I’m bloated as can be and almost felt like throwing up this morning. Really not what I was expecting from this product. Tips on website do not work either. Thinking about drinking a giant coffee this morning or buying laxatives because I need to poop so badly.  What recommendations do you have.

Hey, it’s Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom!

I hope your gut health journey is going great! Remember, Rome wasn’t built in a day! Keep going!

Trust me, you’re not in this alone. I’ve been through some nasty gut health issues, as have most ColonBroom users. But a little bit of consistency, small habit changes, and a scoop of ColonBroom can really make a MAJOR difference. 

In fact, I’d like you to meet Sarah. I hope that her story will inspire you to keep going!

""My constipation got pretty bad, I constantly felt tired, had painful bloating, and started gaining weight. A friend who had gone through similar problems before recommended ColonBroom because it worked for her.

It took a few days but my BMs started becoming regular and I didn’t feel nearly as many cravings or hunger. After a week, I felt a lot less bloated and had more energy, and that inspired me to get my yoga mat out of the closet and work out a little. After two weeks, I lost 12 pounds, don’t feel bloated anymore, and found the inspiration to start being more active! Honestly, I didn’t think a fiber supplement could do so much."" 

See? It might take a day, or a week, or even a few but with the right knowledge, you can get some REALLY dramatic results. 

In fact, I’d love to hear about your story, progress, and expectations! I would be incredibly grateful if you hit reply and took a few minutes to share your thoughts and experience.

There’s the ColonBroom Facebook group (http://trk.colonbroom.com/ls/click?upn=z4MSGTjCvBomUXksLGfA-2FehpOZ64YggyAHoln3IjqjecdZLYDw5trvufYIHqFAmck16RLTGQDLVcYGkuuwlDTND637I74VXoLrkyUGDsCJOpB4LOQODWKy0VDXyFeT1gjJVhE26W8EmLF5Buc7sta3wa4B9nh7OoaGoqQao8Z44-3DSkgA_EkVWd9w5NJxQOdJVB7Aznv3R2R1TK0s7pIVg3f60di8F1twpeLD64wqfVPyywdDD4fjjEax9-2F-2B-2FF0QwssXv2vACwzYAODCNJbeEia7Z4ISxCzU6mHkTj8sBgOh-2F6b8oABFkp5p7E5KDo8dnyTG1i2Kech-2F9zBO-2FBxinPX5UZPnVBhc-2F5vuT85tGLofSvE6LaFZB39KiD8daPirB1Jg6CekjbMrKM2NIxatx7BEv4-2FZrWo9Zc-2BGb1sQNSgON7PqsbpAK-2FlxDGf9qBZGe5KwhXX50XGxNJK6OYl62A5XZc3nkuux2B78XGImu2y5-2ByQsEbQU1DMZ2AMyPef9Lq1XAvuow0IfuALigJ20j0Uly-2FeOn5e38Rd7WsnJl6xux-2Ff8ub) , too, where other users share thoughts and help with tips, tricks, and advice.

3031376,9056747458449,"Hello ColonBroom,

I am sending you this message because I want to order your products but I have a few questions to ask you in order to make sure that your products are for me.

First, I would like to know the composition of the product.

I have seen and read the nutritional value of what you offer but I do not see what exactly is in your boxes as an ingredient?

Also, I would like to know if there is no risk of addiction and whether to take a cure for 6 or 12 months maximum or to take your products for more than a year over a long period?

And finally, I would like to know if there is an appetite suppressant in your ingredients? because it seems that it is not good for health and I wanted to know how your products act on sugar addiction because that is my case.

Thank you for your answer and I hope my questions are clear because I don't speak English very well.

I wish you a nice day.

As an unsatisfied customer of your product, I would like to return for a full refund. It’s not working for me. I eat healthy organic, local farm sourced produce and meats and never have I not pooped for almost 2 weeks. When I reached out I didn’t get the help, I was hoping for. Instead one of your team members insinuated that I had a bad diet to begin with. Anyway, I don’t want this product and would like to send it back. 

Thank you,

There are a lot of key factors that when combined make “the purrfect wipe”: materials you use, wrist movements, before and after preparation like washing your hands or using stools, bidets, etc. And you know what? It’s freakin’ important. Exactly. Healthy wiping can determine oh-so-many things!

While baby-wipes sound like a good option for camping in the woods or music festivals (there are no showers, nothing, you have to survive somehow and take that dirt layer off of your skin) - for everyday use it’s not that recommended. Full of chemicals and moisture, the wetness sits on your tush for long, causing bacteria to change. Well, that leads to irritation, rash, itchiness, and anal discomfort. I think it’s time to ditch those wet wipes for good.
>  
> Wipe from front to back (especially important for women). Ok, this rule sounds weird and there are many different positions that people are used to wiping (have no clue from where they got it - either parental education or the sixth sense). Swiping your TP from front to back will save you from unexpected guests entering your insides. This rule applies for women more, because if not done correctly - mixed feces bacteria can cause urinary tract infection that might go to your urethra. Yikes!
>  
> Don’t scrub your anus! We know you want it to be clean and shiny, but your rectum skin is the most delicate and thinnest part of your body. So hyper-wiping may cause irritation. To prevent that, tap gently, or you know what? Ever thought about using a bidet? Most commonly used in Japan and Europe but slowly this magnificent bum-faucet is invading North America’s market.
>  
> Leave no moisture. Just like wet wipes leave a humid trail in your crack, after taking the number#2 you should dry out your a-hole. Most people don’t do that to the fullest and with pants put on go to the world. Results? Swap-ass. Yes, there is a term, defining a humid hell in your crack-valley. Moisture and wetness encourage the growth of bacterias. And you don’t want to know what happens when anal bacterias rise up. So, try to dry out your rear end.

Hi there!

It's Christine, Head of Nutrition at ColonBroom…

And I think I can help you go from 244 lb to 200 lb (for good).

I know you’ve been bombarded with sketchy weight loss/detox tea ads that promise to make you look like Jeniffer Aniston… So“pooping” the weight off may sound far-fetched at first. But this isn’t some bullcrap detox tea.

It’s a natural fiber supplement your body NEEDS to function properly. 90% of Americans have a major fiber deficiency, which really messes with weight loss. And we've helped over 100,000 people to achieve their goals by pooping.

Let’s run the numbers real quick:

> 90% of women who used ColonBroom felt lighter after 12 hours.
> 80% recorded long-term weight loss without feeling hunger.
> 95% of women noticed more frequent and regular bowel movements.

One delicious scoop of ColonBroom a day and…

> You’ll flush out pounds of ""stuck poop"" and enjoy smooth, full releases that prevent bloating, including the ones caused by hormones.
> You’ll experience way fewer cravings, gain control over your appetite, and start dropping pounds consistently.
> You’ll keep dropping pounds without changing your diet or having to start a workout.

In 3 months, you won’t believe your eyes. And just when you start doubting yourself and think you'll stop losing weight and regain all of it back... you'll keep doing it until you achieve the dream of 200lb you want.

Hey there,
 



We have sent you an email a couple days ago, we want to make sure you've received it. It's regarding your one-month ColonBroom batch.
 



All of us want to have a healthy gut. Of course, a great body shape, a new set of pearly whites or a youthful looking haircut makes it to the top of the list. But aside the outer temporary joys, we all want the same thing. To poop regularly and have a happy gut.
 





No matter your age, taking care of your GI tract is the best investment you can consider. The rule “you are what you eat” applies here too. I don’t know about you but personally, I have no time thinking about my perfectly balanced plate with all the minerals my body needs.
 



That’s why ColonBroom supplement powder is a game-changing tool for that.
 



But it takes more than 30 days to reach maximum results.
 



It’s like using iron or calcium supplements - at least 4-6 weeks have to pass until your body and blood fully adjusts and absorbs the minerals. Since you’ve purchased a while ago one of our products, we’d like you to reconsider trying another detox round for your colon!

Use code IMISSYOU20 to save $20 from your chosen ColonBroom plan!

Hi!

Ever felt nauseous before giving a presentation at work? Or maybe intestinal cramps come in as soon as you start feeling stressed? Well, according to Harvard Medical, quite likely.  👀

 Your gastrointestinal system and brain are really close. Best buds, really… And it’s a bit of a codependent relationship. ColonBroom will help you make sure it’s a healthy relationship that doesn’t drunk-text exes at 3 AM. 🥴
 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 

 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 
It’s all about sending the right signals 🔁
 |

 |

 |
|

 |

| 

 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 
Being a little hungry and thinking about food can instruct your gut to start producing stomach acid. That’s why taking ColonBroom 30 minutes before food is really important – it will help you feel satiated longer and prevent your body from doing this.

This connection is especially visible when considering a person’s mental health. If you’re experiencing anxiety or depression, psychosocial factors can send signals from your brain to the gut, producing symptoms similar to heartburn, cramps, and nausea.
 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 

 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 
OK, don’t freak out 😱
 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 

 |

 |

 |
| 
| 
| 
We know this might be a little stressful to hear. However, there’s a big piece of good news. Arming yourself with knowledge will help you keep everything running smoothly.

Multiple studies show that improving your gut will help psychological conditions. And it works similarly the other way around. This gives us more tools to improve both our mental and physical health. 🙏🏻

 Moral of the story: We’re happy you’re taking steps to take care of your gut. Your brain will thank you. 🧠

I wasn’t aware this was a subscription. I thought it was a one time order. Can you please cancel my subscription. Also, can the amount that was just removed my my account be refunded? I no longer require the product. I’ve attached a copy of what I received as I didn’t even receive an email that this was coming out.

Hi again!

I didn’t hear back from you after my last email! That personal up to 65% discount I got for you is still available. Just in case the email got lost, I wanted to reach out one more time and extend the discount for another 24 hours. Click HERE and save up to 65% with your personal discount.

However, there’s a massive spike in demand – ColonBroom is flying off our warehouse shelves.

That means we can only keep your order and discount available for the next 24 hours!

If you don’t claim it by then, you will lose the discount, and your order might go to someone else.

While fiber supplement alone is a good indicator to beat that excess bloating monster…

...combining it with the right tools will throw you beyond cloud nine.

We mean results!

All you need is:

1. ColonBroom dietary fiber supplement ✅
2. Lots of water ✅
3. Some daily physical activity that shakes everything well ✅

I am interested in trying your product however I just had major spinal fusion surgery on my back only one month ago and I’m on so many medication‘s and trying to relearn how to walk right now. I don’t think it’s a great time for me to go to the bathroom a lot when I am re-learning how to bend over.😅

Please know that I will try your product at a later date I just don’t think now is a good time.

An evidence-based, lab-tested way to beat hunger pangs

Our nutritionists carefully reviewed the blind spots of appetite suppressants and ensured our new formula addresses them with all-natural, organic, and ecologically sourced ingredients.

The end result is a proprietary glucomannan and cellulose blend that beats cravings in a matter of hours without giving you jitters or anxiety.

Thousands of ColonBroom customers have already used our advanced Appetite Suppressant. They report visible changes in the mirror without restricting their food choices.

They’re simply eating less food each meal without feeling hungry or deprived. Small wonder it's flying off our shelves and has already sold out twice.

Important: The product won’t launch to the public until early 2023. So, if you’d like to have first dibs on our limited, customer-only stock… Don’t snooze this email.

We’d really hate to see you missing out. The formula won’t be made available to the public until early 2023. 

So once the stock is gone, it’s gone for good.

We’re sorry.

Due to overwhelming demand, we can’t store your 6 ColonBroom bottles any longer. 

So within the next couple of hours, we’ll be forced to release them for someone else.

We truly want you to experience ColonBroom, so we're approving the code BROOM5 (http://trk.colonbroom.com/ls/click?upn=z4MSGTjCvBomUXksLGfA-2FawqnvGpjhxKWN-2F7sY7ApmrKrCllVXK4jUjJHu8i9UwlvQ-2BAmAvUdUjR7Qtv3qQHRT7TvSSDf47EBhnAKvMox2EzQVMztzNSVgDvjLpecZQwn-2BF0JVfr63lgEpaNQ4QK5oq9oP8fFlq3bIJWBbhjHYI5JnQBJYJXA4ZQ8oJWhKDTX8nbqI0ZBFowju2t859mAamkF7uD5hrG0cZ8Hl-2FCjKIQQMaM7vEPmtW2JEaowk057W9Vacc-2BlLNfrI1nVVr7lg2-2Bh2pAwiPso-2BLBkHdI1SdvUdo35ct-2FOEEtBwS2ELO8ZGEsdKBYGF-2BDM9hjtkx-2FBDdrv9mrPTWOMNHDEYIGSdE-3Dbwyg_BiH-2BDP39EBMb22SlyOzu1uWjOks75O4ul2Cr1cgRB6PmOxwIdiHMmuD9iwgjzfXNfjvPLAF10ttwJnsMgb3n03oMFXN158uvYBw0TiWle0A1ifkg1dLsTHRGf9AryNO9YcvdUl5-2BnvbDzti1uYqC3rFcF-2BRCQ1WIYjBWYFJpdjYymhYgvXvPzZR7SKoo1duIz378Mxl6EUiXae9dOgfjwvsX-2F4z3Shb91PNYfq2lkdC4L6WKv2Ya3c3DuBCAtzCoPqc-2FZ-2FIXf-2Fe5yOuqdYTy6fnIj3Yn7fheq8zzoJDWeyidaSL5p2XGbuDuIlosXKwjaus4h3eoeEd7k8JFFihxmvzWpvmXdptiTl3eo9zr8NvM4xxQrAvNm3CDYAU6EbwrOVcA-2FibUotN0XSWAgJgEPA-3D-3D) for you (save an extra $5).

If you're even remotely interested, hurry.

There's no better time to order. 

If the button below works, your bottles are still available to claim.

Hi there,

Hope your pipes are working well.

I’m Christine, the Head of Nutrition here at ColonBroom. I have one really quick question for you!

On a scale of 1–10, how likely are you to recommend ColonBroom to a friend or colleague?

(1 – not likely; 10 – very likely)

When ColonBroom started, we didn’t expect to become this big. The number of people heading over to our page, asking questions, being curious about the product and its effect showed us that the constipation problem – also, digestive issues, abdominal pain, cramps, hemorrhoids – need to be talked about more.

So, your honest opinion literally means a lot to us.

While our content and communication might be goofy and all the shits and bits – we take great care of our work. Our team of professionals is here to help, answer any questions you might have, and make sure you’re happy with the product.

Besides, in the worst-case scenario, if you flick us off far away, at least we’ll know that we’re doing something wrong and improve for the better.

Thanks again, much appreciated!

Sincerely,
Christine
