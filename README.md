# Client Sentiment Analysis using Pre-trained ML Models

Client Sentiment Analysis using Pre-trained ML Models is a project aimed at analyzing and classifying the sentiment of client feedback using pre-trained machine learning models. The project leverages state-of-the-art natural language processing techniques to determine whether the sentiment expressed in the client's message is positive, negative, or neutral.

## Features

- Utilizes pre-trained ML models for sentiment analysis
- Supports analysis of client feedback in multiple languages (in progress)
- Provides sentiment classification for different types of client messages (in progress)
